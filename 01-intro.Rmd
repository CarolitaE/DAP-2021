# Dryland Agroecosystems Project 

Welcome to the Dryland Agroecosystem bookdown for my master thesis.

The Dryland Agroecosystems project was born in 1985 in collaboration with Colorado State University, the USDA-ARS and local Eastern Colorado dryland farmers. This long term experiment was set up in order to research how cropping intensity can improve the vulnerability of Great Plains dryland agroecosystems. The transition to no-till farming has allowed for more diverse and intensive cropping rotations that improve water use efficiency. No-till management along with increased cropping system intensity has shown gains in surface soil organic C (SOC). The plots are situated along an evapotranspiration gradient. and positioned on a gradient of slight slope positions all corresponding to a unique soil series of the area.

My participation in this long term research experiment builds from the most recent sampling done in May and July of 2021. To explore previous findings even more, in 2021 all 3 sites (Sterling, Stratton and Walsh) were sampled down to 80 cm versus the 20 cm historically sampled. By sampling at a deeper depth we hope to answer questions: Does increased SOC as previously found, consist past 20 cm? How does the slope factor affect SOC dynamics? What treatments enhance deep soil carbon?

Each chapter of this bookdown will contain the data, r code, visual plots and more related to 2021 sampling.

Note: Inorganic carbon values are still being analyzed and will be incomplete in this data set
