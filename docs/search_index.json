The Dryland Agroecosystems project was born in 1985 in collaboration with Colorado State University, the USDA-ARS and local Eastern Colorado dryland farmers. This long term experiment was set up in order to research how cropping intensity can improve the vulnerability of Great Plains dryland agroecosystems. The transition to no-till farming has allowed for more diverse and intensive cropping rotations that improve water use efficiency. No-till management along with increased cropping system intensity has shown gains in surface soil organic C (SOC). The plots are situated along an evapotranspiration gradient. and positioned on a gradient of slight slope positions all corresponding to a unique soil series of the area. My participation in this long term research experiment builds from the most recent sampling done in May and July of 2021. To explore previous findings even more, in 2021 all 3 sites (Sterling, Stratton and Walsh) were sampled down to 80 cm versus the 20 cm historically sampled. By sampling at a deeper depth we hope to answer questions: Does increased SOC as previously found, consist past 20 cm? How does the slope factor affect SOC dynamics? What treatments enhance deep soil carbon? Each chapter of this bookdown will contain the data, r code, visual plots and more related to 2021 sampling. Note: Inorganic carbon values are still being analyzed and will be incomplete in this data set 1.1.1 Experimental Design DAP original sequence design 1.1.1.1 2021 Sampling Design 3 sites where Sterling =1, Stratton =2 and Walsh =3 3 slopes where summit slope =1, side slope =2, toe slope =3 12 treatments 2 reps 6 depths (0-5cm,5-10cm,10-15cm,15-20cm,20-40cm,40-80cm) =1296 samples!

A madera soil sampling probe (Madera industrial Inc. Lincoln,NE) was used to measure the 10-20cm depths. The giddings probe volume was used to calculate BD for the 20-80cm depths. 2.2 Total Carbon and Nitrogen Total carbon (TC) and total Nitrogen (TN) were analyzed using LECO at the USDA ARS laboratory located in Fort Collins CO. Samples were loaded into ceramic boats with a specific samples mass, loaded into the LECO, and their % Carbon and % Nitrogen values are applied to the sample mass. Total C and N values have to then be applied to BD in order to get %Nitrogen T/ha. Using the following calculation %N/g X BD X Depth X 100 (unit conversion factor) 2.3 Inorganic Carbon Inorganic carbon is analyzed using the pressure calcimeter method created by Sherrod et al. This methodology measure %Calcium carbonate that you can further calculate to get %inorganic Carbon %IC will be subtracted from %TC in order to get %OC 2.4 Load Raw Data library(tidyverse) ## ── Attaching packages ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.2 ── ## ✔ ggplot2 3.4.0 ✔ purrr 1.0.1 ## ✔ tibble 3.1.8 ✔ dplyr 1.0.10 ## ✔ tidyr 1.2.1 ✔ stringr 1.5.0 ## ✔ readr 2.1.3 ✔ forcats 0.5.2 ## ── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ── ## ✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter() ## ✖ dplyr::lag() masks stats::lag() library(plotly) ## ## Attaching package: &#39;plotly&#39; ## ## The following object is masked from &#39;package:ggplot2&#39;: ## ## last_plot ## ## The following object is masked from &#39;package:stats&#39;: ## ## filter ## ## The following object is masked from &#39;package:graphics&#39;: ## ## layout library(ggplot2) library(ggplotgui) library(readxl) library(dplyr) library(tidyr) library(bookdown) DAP_ALL_RAW&lt;- read_xlsx(&quot;/Users/carolitalanders/Documents/Grad /DAP/DONT EDIT/DAP_2021_all_data.xlsx&quot;) ## New names: ## • `` -&gt; `...30` ## • `` -&gt; `...36` "],["the-pool-of-tears.html", "Chapter 3 The pool of tears", " Chapter 3 The pool of tears "],["data-tidying-calculations.html", "Chapter 4 Data tidying &amp; Calculations", " Chapter 4 Data tidying &amp; Calculations library(tidyverse) library(plotly) library(ggplot2) library(ggplotgui) library(readxl) library(dplyr) library(tidyr) library(bookdown) ##Tidying DAP_tidy &lt;- DAP_ALL_RAW %&gt;% rename(ID = `unique ID`, BD = `Bulk Density g/cm^3`, TC = `LECO carbon`, TN = `LECO Nitrogen`, Depth = EndDepth) %&gt;% select(ID, SITE, SLOPE, STRIP, Rotation, Depth, BD,TN, TC) %&gt;% mutate(across(c(SITE, SLOPE, STRIP), as.numeric)) ##Data Calculations DAP_tidy$TNperha&lt;- with(DAP_tidy, TN * BD * Depth * 100) DAP_tidy$TCperha&lt;- with(DAP_tidy, TC * BD * Depth *100) "],["a-caucus-race-and-a-long-tale.html", "Chapter 5 A caucus-race and a long tale 5.1 Plotting TN across all sites, slope and rotation 5.2 Plotting TC across all sites, slope and rotation", " Chapter 5 A caucus-race and a long tale #Data Visualization library(bookdown) library(tidyverse) library(plotly) library(ggplot2) library(ggplotgui) library(readxl) library(dplyr) library(tidyr) 5.1 Plotting TN across all sites, slope and rotation graph_TN_all_sites&lt;- ggplot(DAP_tidy, aes(x = Depth, y = TNperha, colour = SLOPE)) + geom_point() + facet_grid( . ~ Rotation ) + labs(x = &#39;Depth (cm) &#39;, y = &#39;TN tons/ha&#39;) + ggtitle(&#39;TN across all sites &#39;) + theme_bw() graph_TN_all_sites ## Warning: Removed 283 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`). 5.2 Plotting TC across all sites, slope and rotation graph_TC_all_sites&lt;- ggplot(DAP_tidy, aes(x = Depth, y = TCperha, colour = SLOPE)) + geom_point() + facet_grid( . ~ Rotation ) +labs(x = &#39;Depth (cm) &#39;, y = &#39;TC tons/ha&#39;) + ggtitle(&#39;TC across all sites &#39;) + theme_bw() graph_TC_all_sites ## Warning: Removed 283 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).
